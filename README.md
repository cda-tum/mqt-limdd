# MQT LIMDD - A quantum circuit simulator based on decision diagrams written in C++

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This simulator uses LIMDD type decision diagrams which only cover a subset of functionality available in [mqt-ddsim](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-ddsim) and [mqt-core](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-limdd).

A tool for classical quantum circuit simulation developed as part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io) (_MQT_)[^1] by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).
It builds upon [MQT Core](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-core), which forms the backbone of the MQT.

## Usage

The simulator comes with a stand alone executable that takes input via the command line and output their results as json object.

The following example assumes the simulator has been build from source in the `build/` directory.
Afterwards, there will be an executable `ddsim_simple` in `build/apps/` which can be used to simulate (among others) OpenQASM files. All executables support the `--help` parameter to list their options.

```
build/apps/ddsim_simple --help
MQT LIMDD by https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/ -- Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]          produce help message
  --shots arg            number of measurements (if the algorithm
                         does not contain non-unitary gates, weak
                         simulation is used) (default: 0)
  --ps                   print simulation stats (applied gates, sim.
                         time, and maximal size of the DD)
  --simulate_file arg    simulate a quantum circuit given by file
                         (detection by the file extension)
[...]
